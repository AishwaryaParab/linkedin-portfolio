Instead...

Keep your head high and work! 

I know the hook sounds clickbaity but what I want to drive home is:

📍 Be proud of your work and share it wherever possible. 
📍Your clientele will always be around but if your head is down, you’re missing on them!
📍Look at the right places, do what's ought to be done to thrive. 

Because having fear of anything is not worth it.

There'll always be people judging you. 

On the flip side, there'll always be clients looking out for you!

P.S: I'm currently working on conducting my first webinar with a small group of people. Will share details soon! 💙

Until next time! ✨️

Happy to share that I've been awarded the Gold Medal in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering by Goa University. 👩🏻‍🎓

And the best part is achieving this feat while freelancing in college. 

Freelancing helped me pay my college fees. 💵

In fact, I still remember completing a client copy and teaching online one day before my exams!

Not gonna lie, I did go back and forth about leaving freelancing and concentrating on studies alone because it was very hectic. 

But I'm glad I didn't take that route. 

Today, earning this Gold Medal makes me even happier because the hustle behind managing sooo many things truly paid off. ✅

I never imagined getting a Gold Medal because I never considered myself to be in that race. 

My sole focus was on freelancing but getting this today made me realise: 

➡️ Life has its own ways to surprise you! Always be prepared and ready for such unimaginable opportunities 💙

Thank you for sticking by and always supporting. 🙏🏻✨

Something fun, exciting and valuable is dropping soon!!

Stay tuned. Until next time! 💫

1. Manage your finances early on. Learn about all investment options and figure out what you’re comfortable with. 🤑

2. Use a Money Manager app to track your earnings and spendings. Gives you a reality check of where your money is going. 💰

3. Your relationship with yourself is going to be life-long. Learn self-acceptance and self-love. 🫶

4. You’re the most important person in your life but not in others' lives. 🙃

5. No one can teach you time management and productivity hacks if you don’t have a strong purpose or vision. 💪

6. It's fine to have unproductive days! The sun will rise again tomorrow 💙

7. Start travelling early on and click loads of pictures while you enjoy the views. The pictures will help you relive all the memories. 🤩

8. You can create multiple sources of income (active / passive) at any age. ✅️

9. Nothing comes easy. A full-time job is not easy. Founding your own business is not easy. Freelancing is not easy. Being self-employed is not easy. ❌️

10. Consistency beats anything anytime! ✨️

11. When you have a roadmap to follow, get an accountability partner who has the same vision as you. You stay accountable to the roadmap in this way. 👫

12. If you give your best at work, work will reward you. Focus on the process, not the results. 🎯

13. Pen-paper to-do lists help more than fancy to-do apps. 📖

14. Always break down a complex task into tiny achievable components and get working. Otherwise, overthinking will kill you. 🤏

15. It's fine to not read tons of non-fiction books or not medidate or not wake up early morning. You do what suits you the best. 🙌

16. Complete 6-8 hours of sleep anyhow. 7 hrs sleep is the best!! This is something I don’t compromise on, come what may! 😴

17. If you can't say anything nice, don’t say anything at all. 🤫

18. Be kind to your parents and take care of them because it's your turn now. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

19. Occasionally, go for an outing with your parents and just enjoy! 🥳

20. Everything seems difficult to work on until you actually work on it! 🫡

21. Give gifting a priority every year. More than buying stuff for yourself, gifting would give you more happiness. 🎁

22. Don't shop to show-off. You'll only attract reel people rather than real ones. 🛍

23. Create your personal brand to see your progress when your turn old. And also to showcase your work to people across the borders! 😉

24. Trust the process of life. 💚

Let me know which one was your favourite!

The ones with a heart has my heart 😝

Until next time! ✨️

But once you master it, there's no looking back!

If you're struggling with consistency, here's something that may help:

📍Gamify tasks using apps. I use HabitKit to keep track of streaks. 

📍 Don't miss doing it for more than two days. No matter whatever happens, don't go beyond two days 🙃

📍Have an achievable goal in mind that you want to reach with this consistency. The goal shouldn't be too easy or difficult to achieve!

You can go one step beyond by posting your updates on Twitter / X. Many people are building in public and this solves a bigger purpose:

Not being afraid of failing in public which is a very powerful mindset to have!

Hope this helped ✨

Because they are backed up with great advices, necessary resources and of course, a good cushion of cash in case they fail.

This is what I used to think! 

And I wholeheartedly believed in it. 

For example, if you're stuck at SOMETHING. 
📍Rich people will hire someone to do it rather than learning and implementing it themselves. 

📍Middle class people will prefer learning it and then implementing it. 

Both ways are fine but we need extra efforts and time for the 2nd option. 

Is that a fair tradeoff? 🤔

This question always made me think that people like us won't be able to cultivate a growth mindset. 

But I was wrong! 

Most of the founders I've spoken to here on LinkedIn come from humble beginnings. 

There were times when they were earning peanuts, without a cushion of cash. 

But they still chose to be resilient and march towards success. 

So, I've learnt that having money does help a lot but not having enough will never hinder your growth. 

After all, it's your leap of faith.

And recently, when I recovered from my illness, I was perfectly fine to work

But I procrastinated due to my laziness.

I'd taken a good week's rest and didn't need any of that anymore. 

However, all I did during this time was sleep and watch food videos on YouTube! 🤦🏻‍♀️

So, if you’ve piled up work, do not wish for more hours in your day. 

Just prioritize and do it anyway!

If you remember my 2023 rewind, it wasn't my best year. 

Cut to 2024 - which turned out to be the best year of my lifeee!!! 💙🙏

Here's the list of Special Things that made this year Special:

📍Felicitated as the University Gold Medallist 🥇
Even though I graduated long time ago, the convocation was held in 2024 and it was nothing less than a dream to be awarded a Gold Medal. 

📍Onboarded my First Flight ✈️
Coming from a middle-class family, flying to travel was never even in our list. Buses and trains were our go-to. 

This year I took my first flight to Bangalore and literally, behaved like a 10-year old kid at the airport. 🤣

Everything was so new and exciting. 😄

📍Onboarded my First International Flight 🛫
Yesss!! First domestic and international flight in the same year. 

And yet again, I behaved like a 10-year old at the airport. 😂

📍Travelled to Singapore 🇸🇬
This is the first country I've visited and all with my own money. I'm kind of very proud of myself for doing this and it motivates me to do better in life! 💙

📍Awardsss! 🏆
Awarded the Bravo Individual Award & Most Valuable Player in Development Award at Persistent Systems. 

Thanks to my amazing team who would always appreciate my work. 🙏

📍Switching my Job 👩‍💻
I don’t know if all switches are tough but at least my first one was the toughest. 

I was looking for better opportunities but the opportunity that I ended up getting came out of nowhere!

LinkedIn did help me get my new job and I'm happy that this opportunity found me! 💙

Miss my people at PSL though! 💝

📍Identified as TOP 1% of Frontend Development & Software Development on LinkedIn 👌
I was delighted to be recognized as an expert in my fields on LinkedIn. So, thanks LinkedIn. 🫶

📍Released my First Ebook 📗
I never knew I could create a product. All I had were my own notes on React Hooks which I would refer from time to time. 

Polished those notes, put them into a format, included more examples, designed for aesthetics and after months, the book was ready!! ✨️

You can grab your copy here at a 30% discount - https://lnkd.in/gViGnvpb

And thanks for the immense support. Means a lot. 💙

📍Bought an Expensive Phone 📱
Before this, I'd purchased two phones with my own money and this is the 3rd one and the price keeps increasing! 🤦🏻‍♀️

Hopefully, I make the right use of it. 

📍Mentored Students 👩‍🏫
Our generation used to fear asking questions but the newer generations don't. So many 18 to 20 year olds had questions about career and growing their personal brand. 

Mentored these students for FREE on LinkedIn and Gmeet. I was paid with gratitude & purpose! 💚

And that's a wrap. 🎬

If you reached here, thank you for being a wellwisher and do share the one thing that you love 2024 for. 

Wishing you a very happy & prosperous new year! 🎉🥳

And I'll see you next year! ✨️

But it's no longer there. 

Startups are not easy. But the founder had a smile while talking about shutting the business down.

🔸️He didn't have regrets of starting up because it was quite early for him 

🔸️They raised an insane amount of money. I bet he has made strong connections. 

🔸️And the kind of exposure and experience would have been unimaginable! 

Such things really make you think, doubt and ponder! ✨️

Realistic because its curated by me from experience and not ChatGPT-generated. 🙃

📍 Learn HTML & CSS

📍 Build a simple responsive Portfolio Website using HTML & CSS. Include simple animations using CSS Keyframes. 

📍 Learn JS: Selectors, Event Listeners, Event Bubbling, Hoisting, Closures, Functions, Objects, Array Methods and so much more. Refer MDN Docs for JS. 

📍 Spend 2 months in learning JS Concepts. 

📍 Build an interactive website using HTML, CSS and JS. 

📍 Learn React.js: JSX, Concept of Virtual DOM, Hooks, Context API, using map, filter, reduce on array of objects etc. 

📍 Build a clone of popular web apps (not websites). Eg. AirBnB, Netflix, Blog App etc. 

📍 Learn Redux Toolkit from docs or YT videos. Build an ecommerce app with cart and wishlist functionality to understand global state management with Redux. 

📍 Shift from plain CSS to Tailwind CSS gradually. 

📍 Learn Next.js: Benefits of SSR over CSR, in-built optimizations, app router and API generation, static site generation etc. 

📍Learn Framer Motion or GSAP to include stunning animations in your apps. 

Once you reach this stage, start experimenting with new stuff. 

For example, web sockets, react form, zustand, zod, charts, material ui, ant design, booking apps, CRM integrations, etc. 

BONUS - Practice BigFrontend problems and develop POCs of small yet reusable components like quiz, stepper, stopwatch etc. 

If you're a beginner, this roadmap will help you gain 3+ years of experience in one year. 🚀

I know developers from the industry and I'm not kidding! 🙃

If you found this helpful, share it with your friends and don't forget to follow Aishwarya Parab.

- Got leads for LinkedIn content marketing services
- LinkedIn pushed my previous posts & my impressions weren't much affected
- Received connection requests every single day!

Was it easy?

No. 

Was it manageable? 

Yes. 

And because I started managing things early on in my career, I understood how time management works. 

No matter how many videos or courses you take on time management, you won't get it until you manage it. 

The word itself is simple right - Time management (manage your time).

How you do it, which tools you use to do it, which techniques you use, all of it is secondary. 

But once you learn it, you'll have a sense of belief that you can meet any deadlines. 🚀

And trust me, you'll deliver exceptional results every single time!

So, explore as much as possible and deliberately take things on your plate ✨

👉🏻 Do you often make planned or spontaneous decisions?

Initially, I believed I was a planner, as I often scheduled and organized my tasks. 

But upon reflection, I discovered that my most successful decisions were spontaneous ones.

📍I started freelancing without even knowing it was called freelancing. I simply wanted to try something new and went for it. 

This spontaneous choice allowed me to pay my college fees on my own. ✨

📍Coming from an Electronics background, I knew nothing about creating websites. 

I dove into coding out of curiosity, not for internships or placements, but just to learn. And this unplanned venture has been incredibly rewarding! 💫

Reflecting on my journey, I realize that many of my significant achievements were the results of unplanned, spontaneous decisions. 

Sometimes, too much planning will take you nowhere and just taking the first step will take you to an unplanned destination where you might end up enjoying the journey!

So, explore as much as you can. 

But before that, ask the same question to yourself and understand your persona!

Until next time ✨

How many times have you hesitated to get your first product, post, video or any other creation out?

Why? 🤔

Just because it was not as perfect as you imagined it to be. 🤷🏻‍♀️

While your competitors might have already launched something similar, understood what can be done better and launched a superior version of it at a higher price!

This just shows how we can kill our own ideas by procrastinating, even after having all the necessary skills. 

Don't make that mistake. ❌

📍If you have a product in mind, get working and launch it. 

📍If you wish to create a like-minded audience for you, start posting around your niche. 

📍If you want to provide value through videos, shoot-edit-upload-market with no fancy equipment or additional cost. 

You got this 💪🏻

Until next time! ✨

    content: `How to write content that delivers value yet engages customers!! 🫶🏻

Here is a 3-step process I follow for my freelance clients:

🪣 Make buckets of themes that you'd like to talk about. And stick to them for a substantial period. 

🪝 While writing a post, start with a hook so that your readers get hooked and continue reading. 

Talk about the topic in the first para, explain its power in the second one and finally give an example related to it so that your audience can relate to what you're saying. 

📞 Add a call-to-action in the last para so that your audience can interact with the post or DM you personally for your services. 

Sounds simple? Let's have a look at an example: 👇🏻


"You're missing out on 40% clients because of this reason 👇🏻

It's about not having a Personal Brand which is the unique combination of your skills, personality, and experiences that make you who you are professionally. 

In a crowded marketplace, personal branding helps you stand out, build trust and open doors to new opportunities & collaborations. 🌱

One of our clients built a personal brand by consistently sharing valuable tips and insights on LinkedIn around social media expertise. 

Today, she has grown her following to 50K+ on LinkedIn and saw a 40% increase in client inquiries. 🚀

Her personal brand elevated her value in the industry. Are you ready to elevate your brand? 🤩

If that's a yes, we're here to help. 

Let's connect and chat about how we can craft a standout brand for you. 🚀"


And...cut. 🎬

If you're looking forward to elevating your brand, let's connect and chat about how we can craft a standout brand for you! 😉

Follow Aishwarya Parab for more such valuable content. 

I'm all about coding, content and collaborations. 😉

Until next time! ✨

    content: `Sometimes, being clueless and going all in helps more than planning everything out and waiting for the right moment. 

Don't think about whether you would be replaced by AI and whether you should learn coding now.

Do it anyway, you will get somewhere regardless. 

Don't think about whether you should start your business right away. 

Start anyway, you will learn along the journey. 

Don't think about whether you should publish your book or no. 

Begin writing anyway because there's always space for a newer perspective. 

Our biggest obstacle is our narrow minded approach which can't really comprehend that the world is a bigger place. ✨

    content: `I started investing in stocks at the age of 20. 

Back then my only source of income was freelancing. I used to freelance in content writing, designing and teaching coding. 

At that time, I had one dream stock in mind which I thought I'll never buy since it was an expensive buy and way out of my league at the time. 

Recently, when the market dipped, I purchased my dream stocks! 🤩

The stock which was once out of my league, was definitely buyable now.

And that made me happy about what I am doing right now in life. 

Lesson learnt - Everything is in your league. You need to be patient and work hard in the right direction! 💪🏻

Ultimately, it really depends on how bad you want your desires to turn into reality. ✨️

But before that, I thought of proofreading the book to avoid any errors. 

I'd earlier proofread it but something pushed me to do it again. 

And I found 6 errors in my eBook! 😶
 
These were minor spelling mistakes but if I'd not proofread my book again, I wouldn't know they existed. 

2 lessons learnt:

📍There's always room for improvement. Keep iterating. 

📍You will trust your product if you’ve put in tremendous efforts to give it a life!

My first ever eBook will be live on 1st Dec 2024. 🫶

Nervous and excited for the launch 💙✨️

And more importantly, want to hear your feedback!

See you on 1st Dec 🚀

A few years ago I took up a personal challenge to journal my day in a proper notebook for a month.

I still have that notebook and reading whatever I'd written always makes me feel nostalgic. 😊

Additionally, journaling keeps you accountable and shows you a mirror of what you're making out of your day. 

I've realised that I won't be able to continue writing on a notebook for a longer time period. So, I've switched to a diary app. 

Nothing complex. Just does the job of taking an account of your day with PICTURES. 

Every single day, I make it a point to attach a picture that was relevant to that day. 

There's a different joy in doing this. The link to the diary app that I use is in the comments below 👇🏻

Let me know if you've journalled before and found it helpful or no!

Until next time! 💫

Instead...

Keep your head high and work! 

I know the hook sounds clickbaity but what I want to drive home is:

📍 Be proud of your work and share it wherever possible. 
📍Your clientele will always be around but if your head is down, you’re missing on them!
📍Look at the right places, do what's ought to be done to thrive. 

Because having fear of anything is not worth it.

There'll always be people judging you. 

On the flip side, there'll always be clients looking out for you!

P.S: I'm currently working on conducting my first webinar with a small group of people. Will share details soon! 💙

Until next time! ✨️

📍Claude
- Is definitely superior when it comes to coding since it uses sonnet.
- Great to figure out bug fixes and better feature implementations. 
- Gives more up-to-date results than ChatGPT. 

📍Bolt
- Does a wonderful job when given an image and a good prompt.
- Helps you get a preview of the implementation and suggest any code changes with their in-built code editor.

📍ChatGPT
- Provides quick TypeScript fixes
- Great for improving your existing implementation, if you know how you want it to be. 
- Coding efficiency is not as good as claude or bolt.

Now that I've helped you, I need some favour in return!

I'm in search of an AI tool that generates professional presentations and pdf docs. 

If you know of any, please drop them in the comments or DM me. 

Thanks a lot in advance! 

Until next time! ✨️
