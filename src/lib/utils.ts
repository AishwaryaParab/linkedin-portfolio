  After 10 years in the industry, here's what I've learned:
  
  1. Design solves problems
  2. Users don't read, they scan
  3. Simplicity > Complexity
  4. Data drives decisions
  5. Empathy is everything
  
  Thread ðŸ§µ on how to apply these principles...

  The secret?
  Stop selling. Start solving.
  
  3 mindset shifts that changed everything:
  1. Focus on pain points, not features
  2. Listen more than you talk
  3. Follow up with value, not pressure
